* I believe in **science** !

* I adore **cats** !

* I'm French 🇫🇷

* I'm really into tech, especially:

  * **CODING**!
  * Hardware
  * Gaming
  * Open source
  * System & network administration
  * Basically, anything related to computers!

* I'm a Developer/Programmer (*though I guess the fact you're reading this on GitHub kind of says it all, right?*)

  * I specialize in backend development and Discord bots.
  * TypeScript ❤️ (JavaScript)
  * Python
  * HTML, CSS, React
  * A bit of C++
  * Some .dll work in C#
  * Minecraft datapacks (mcfunction)

* I enjoy peace and cozy vibes.

* I'm not the most social person (…and also a little *very* shy.). But if you reach out and you're respectful, I'll be happy to chat! 😊

* I dislike conflict—I prefer peace and quiet. But that’s no excuse for not speaking up.

* My favorites technologies include:
  * **[TypeScript ❤️](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)**
  * [Zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod)
  * [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
  * [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/)
  * [Bruno](https://www.usebruno.com/)
  * [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org/)
  * [DnSpyEx](https://github.com/dnSpyEx/dnSpy)
  * [PaperMC](https://papermc.io/)
  <!-- * [tRPC](https://trpc.io/) -->

* I am **not** a bot 🤖

* I'm a man 🧐

* Romance? Nah. I’m all about good friends!
